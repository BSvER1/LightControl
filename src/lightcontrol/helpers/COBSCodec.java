/** 
 * Encoder/Decoder implementing Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing (COBS) for 
 * efficient, reliable, unambigous packet framing regardless of packet content, 
 * making it is easy for applications to recover from malformed packet payloads. 
 * <p> 
 * For details, see the <a 
 * href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org/papers/COBSforToN.pdf">paper </a>. In 
 * case the link is broken, get it from the <a 
 * href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org">paper's author </a>. 
 * <p> 
 * Quoting from the paper: "When packet data is sent over any serial medium, a 
 * protocol is needed by which to demarcate packet boundaries. This is done by 
 * using a special bit-sequence or character value to indicate where the 
 * boundaries between packets fall. Data stuffing is the process that transforms 
 * the packet data before transmission to eliminate any accidental occurrences 
 * of that special framing marker, so that when the receiver detects the marker, 
 * it knows, without any ambiguity, that it does indeed indicate a boundary 
 * between packets. 
 * <p> 
 * COBS takes an input consisting of bytes in the range [0,255] and produces an 
 * output consisting of bytes only in the range [1,255]. Having eliminated all 
 * zero bytes from the data, a zero byte can now be used unambiguously to mark 
 * boundaries between packets. 
 * <p> 
 * This allows the receiver to synchronize reliably with the beginning of the 
 * next packet, even after an error. It also allows new listeners to join a 
 * broadcast stream at any time and without failing to receive and decode the 
 * very next error free packet. 
 * <p> 
 * With COBS all packets up to 254 bytes in length are encoded with an overhead 
 * of exactly one byte. For packets over 254 bytes in length the overhead is at 
 * most one byte for every 254 bytes of packet data. The maximum overhead is 
 * therefore roughly 0.4% of the packet size, rounded up to a whole number of 
 * bytes. COBS encoding has low overhead (on average 0.23% of the packet size, 
 * rounded up to a whole number of bytes) and furthermore, for packets of any 
 * given length, the amount of overhead is virtually constant, regardless of the 
 * packet contents." 
 * <p> 
 * This class implements the original COBS algorithm, not the COBS/ZPE variant. 
 * <p> 
 * There holds: <code>decode(encode(src)) = src</code>. 
 * <p> 
 * Performance Note: The JDK 1.5 server VM runs <code>decode(encode(src))</code> 
 * at about 125 MB/s throughput on a commodity PC (2 GHz Pentium 4). Encoding is 
 * the bottleneck, decoding is extremely cheap. Obviously, this is way more 
 * efficient than Base64 encoding or similar application level byte stuffing 
 * mechanisms.
